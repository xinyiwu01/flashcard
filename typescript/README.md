## Compiling and running

The project is setup with npm already. `npm install` will install packages, `npm run compile` will run the TypeScript compiler, and `npm run start` will start the compiled program. *Tip*: When using `npm run start`, type `--` after start to ensure arguments you pass are interpreted as part of the `flashcard` command.
